feat: add smart-branch feature

Adds the `smart-branch` feature to streamline branch naming
and creation. This feature leverages AI to suggest branch
names based on the user's intent.

- Introduces a `branch` subcommand in `cli.py` with options
  for intent, type, and skipping the initial commit.
- Implements branch name generation and type detection logic
  in `src/tools/branch_manager.py`.
- Updates `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files.
